            <h2>Piazza Panic</h2>

            <p>It seems to be a quiet day at the Piazza: there aren't that many students and staff around
                this time of the year, so most of the kitchen staff are away on leave - you only have three
                cooks. Suddenly, a crowd bursts into the restaurant: it's an open day, and they all want to eat
                at once! Make the most of your kitchen and your staff, and face up to the challenge of
                serving an impatient and demanding crowd!</p>
